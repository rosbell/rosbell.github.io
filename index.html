Teaching, Learning and Students (TLS) Virtual Teaching and Support (VTS) core group have been working with your help to research and identify practice for supporting learning remotely - from TLS and beyond - and to agree standards which our support must meet for our learners and ourselves. We feel that the above quotes from critical educator Jessie Stommel neatly summarise how would like to offer VTS, and why.

You can read more about the approach <a href="https://medium.com/@foreducators/virtual-teaching-and-support-1be25054a7f">here</a>.

Does it requre any downloads or considerable bandwidth? Are you able to provide a transcript? Are you able to provide an offline version?
          <p>
              All content (including media, or downloadable files such as PDFs), should be accessible around the world. If it's on manchester.ac.uk, it's safe. Anywhere else, contact the eLearning team who will be able to upload a copy to manchester.ac.uk and provide links and guidance. You do not need to do this if the content is part of an MLE embedded session plan - when it passes QA, this already happens automatically. Ask eLearning with any questions.
